# Shopping Cart Bug

# Challenge Description

There are some nasty bugs lurking around in this Shopping Cart Widget. Your task is to hunt them down and elimate them!

## Requirements

- The total price should update when the quantity of any item updates
- Prices should always display with 2 decimal places (for individual items and the total)
- There can be no negative values for the quantity.

## Other Considerations

> If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

> TailwindCSS is preinstalled with the default config. It might be helpful for you, if you want to have some styles. (Not obligatory)

## Example of finished App

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise.
